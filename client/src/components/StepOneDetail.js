                <p>Step One Dance Company is a modern dance group which combines exciting choreography with state-of-the-art stage technology. My role was to create an exciting logo and a set of posters that would match the energy of the performances.</p>

                <p>Going into this project, I knew that simplicity was going to be important. It would be featured on many posters, for a variety of shows, so I didnâ€™t want it to ever overshadow the title of the show. </p>

                <p>I also knew that it would be helpful to have a logo that could easily shift palette. That would allow maximum flexibility in the poster artwork and allow for more variety which would help differentiate shows.</p>
